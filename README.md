From **🐬Daxya🐬** for **you**:

```brainfuck
Hey there! I know that this list is so trite, but...
I love old computer games, I want to become a programmer, and though Ive been interested in it for a long time...
But in fact Ive been doing this seriously for only two years, Ive tried Java, C#, Lua.
I 50/50 well know HTML&CSS.⚙️

I dont want to be a typical dude who enjoys an increased level of abstraction.
Choosing python as the first programming language is a mistake on the way to the "iron level".🚀
